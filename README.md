* Applied classical machine learning methods with HOG features, and built deep learning models using CNNs to develop a garbage image classification system.

* Implemented transfer learning and fine-tuning on pre-trained models such as ResNet50 and VGG16.

* Achieved 89.8% accuracy on the test set for multi-class waste categorization.
